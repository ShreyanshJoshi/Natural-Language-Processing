    "\n",
    "I have, in the below project worked on IMDB movie review sentiment classification.Each movie review is a variable sequence of words and the sentiment of each movie review must be classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000  movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment.\n",

    "### Word Embedding\n",
    "1. We will map each movie review as a vector, a popular technique when working with text called word embedding. This is a technique where words are encoded as real-valued vectors in a high dimensional space, where the similarity between words in terms of meaning translates to closeness in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides a convenient way to convert positive integer representations of words into a word embedding by an **Embedding** layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will map each word onto a 32 length real valued vector. We will also limit the total number of words that we are interested in modeling to the 5000 most frequent words, and zero out the rest. Finally, the sequence length (number of words) in each review varies, so we will constrain each review to be 500 words, truncating long reviews and pad the shorter reviews with zero values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined how the data will be prepared and modeled, we are ready to develop an LSTM model to classify the sentiment of movie reviews."
